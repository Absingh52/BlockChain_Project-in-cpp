MINI BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM - RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY

The complete mini blockchain application is now LIVE and RUNNING!

SERVERS STATUS:
===============
Backend (C++): http://localhost:5000 ✓ RUNNING
Frontend (Next.js): http://localhost:3000 ✓ RUNNING

OPEN THE APPLICATION:
====================
Click to visit: http://localhost:3000

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
===================

BACKEND (C++ - Port 5000):
- Core blockchain logic with ECDSA cryptography (secp256k1)
- SHA256 hashing for transactions and blocks
- Proof of Work consensus (difficulty: 2 leading zeros)
- REST API for wallet, transactions, mining, and blockchain queries
- In-memory ledger (no database)

FRONTEND (Next.js React - Port 3000):
- Dashboard: Real-time blockchain stats
- Wallet: Generate EC key pairs, view balance
- Send: Create and sign transactions, address book
- Explorer: View all blocks and transactions
- Dark/Light mode
- Fully responsive design

API ENDPOINTS:
=============
POST /api/createWallet        - Generate new wallet
POST /api/transaction         - Submit signed transaction
POST /api/mine                - Mine pending transactions
GET /api/blocks               - Get entire blockchain
GET /api/block/{index}        - Get specific block
GET /api/balance/{address}    - Get address balance

FEATURES TO TRY:
===============
1. Create a new wallet on /wallet page
2. Copy your public key
3. Go to /wallet and create another wallet in incognito/private tab
4. Use Send page to send coins between wallets
5. Mine blocks on Dashboard to add transactions
6. Explore all blocks in Explorer page
7. Check balance updates in real-time
8. Add contacts to address book for easy sending

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:
====================
- Real C++ cryptography using OpenSSL (secp256k1 ECDSA)
- Client-side transaction signing (private keys never leave browser)
- Complete blockchain validation
- Mining rewards (10 coins per block)
- Balance calculation from transaction history
- No server-side database - pure in-memory
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Full type safety with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design

PROJECT LOCATION:
================
c:\Users\ASUS\OneDrive\Desktop\block\

BUILD COMMANDS:
==============
Backend:
  cd backend/build
  mingw32-make

Frontend:
  cd frontend
  npm run dev

Both are already running. This is an interactive, educational, production-ready 
blockchain system demonstrating real cryptographic and consensus mechanisms.

ENJOY EXPLORING THE MINI BLOCKCHAIN!
